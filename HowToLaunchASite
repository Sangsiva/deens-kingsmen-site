To launch the website, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server. Here's how to do it:

Open a terminal
Navigate to your project directory:
bash
cd /Users/sivakumarsaminathan/Desktop/projects/deensite
For Python 3, run:
bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
Then open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost:8000
The site will be served on port 8000. To stop the server, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

If you prefer a different port, just change the number (e.g., 8001 instead of 8000).
